bitstorm.js
===========

The bitstorm.js project is an HTML5 game and tools development platform
targeting modern browsers. You'll probably have the best experience with Google
Chrome, but generally the project will avoid using APIs supported by only a
single browser - for example, bitstorm.js uses indexedDB instead of Filesystem
APIs for client-side caching of data files.

This project is under heavy development and may not always be usable - you may
want to wait until it stabilizes a bit before using it. Follow its progress:
